    "##### Detaching scripts to run in virtual environment when app is shut down #####\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you find instructions on how to create a virtual environment and run your scripts within a tmux session. \n",
    "This will allow your job/scripts to run, even if you shut down the apps and ucloud. This can be beneficial if you have scripts that take a long time to run. \n",
    "NB! The scripts will only run as long as you job does not expire. So make sure you have enough time allocated to your job - remember that you can always find your job under \"Runs\" and add more time, if the job is about to expire. \n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions assume that your job includes a script that runs on the jupyterLab app. If you are using another app, just start that one instead of jupyter in the first step. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start a jupyterLab job \n",
    "- Remember to attach all folders you'll need (including output folders that your script will need). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Open job terminal \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create virtual environment (python) \n",
    "- $ python -m venv env_name \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Activate virtual environment \n",
    "- $ source ./env_name/bin/activate \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Install all packages required for your job/script\n",
    "- Note that you'll also have to pip install ipykernel \n",
    "- $ pip install ipykernel \n",
    "- $ pip install nilearn \n",
    "- $ pip install .....\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Create a tmux session (this will automatically enter you into the tmux session) \n",
    "- $ tmux new -s session_name \n",
    "\n",
    "7) Run your script \n",
    "- Navigate to the job folder that contains your python script \n",
    "- $ python my_script.py \n",
    "\n",
    "Now your script is running, and its outputs can be seen in the tmux session. \n",
    "The script will continue to run even though you quit the session, the terminal, the app or ucloud. \n",
    "Your tmux session is within the virtual environment, so everytime you want to open it and check how it's going, you have to activate the virtual environment first and then access the tmux session. \n",
    "\n",
    "Useful commands: \n",
    "- To get out of tmux session and back to terminal\n",
    "    - $ Ctrl+b d \n",
    "- To activate virtual environment (from /work) \n",
    "    - $ source ./env_name/bin/activate \n",
    "- To access tmux session (from virtual environment) \n",
    "    - $ tmux a -t session_name "
